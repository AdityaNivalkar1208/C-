// The formula for annual compound interest, including principal sum, is:
// A = P (1 + r/n) ^ (nt)
// A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
// P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
// r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
// n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
// t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for
// Total compounded interest = P (1 + r/n)^(nt) â€“ P
